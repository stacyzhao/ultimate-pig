# Ultimate PiG

### Objective
Create a simulation of different types of players of Pig Solitaire. You will start with a base Player class that only rolls once per turn. Then create Player subclasses -- at least 2 -- that have different strategies.

#### Rules of Pig Solitaire

In 7 turns, you are attempting to get the highest score possible.

Each turn, you have two choices:

⋅⋅⋅ Roll. Roll a six-sided die. If it comes up one, your turn is over and you add nothing to your score. If it comes up two through six, you add that number to your turn total and choose again.
⋅⋅⋅ Hold. If you hold, you add the turn total to your score.
